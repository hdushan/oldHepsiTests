--------------Any Assumptions made about cards ------------------

@19 All products have images

@56 assuming URL is correct as currently implemented, not as given in scenario 2 --- not tested

@61 assumes that the image filename (i.e. telephon_15322435.jpg) is the same for all image resolutions
@62 assumes that product always has a description

@116 This story was intended to include the preservation of the shopping cart when returning to the site after leaving as AC
@116 Scenario 2, showing the visual indication on cart has been moved to #244

@141 refers to the 'Only' filter rather than 'Shipping style' which does not appear to be present on the page

@248 A login link is no longer required in the footer

@276 Nothing to test for this as it appears to be a placeholder

@373 Div containing offer flags should be distinguished by a class

@460 Should create two buttons, one to add another item and one to go to the cart
@460 When adding two of the same item to the cart, that item should only appear once in the cart but with a quantity of 2

@467 We assume that all items in the 'deal of the day' list should have a discounted price, and hence an original price. (not the case in the QA environment, as of 2014-10-28)
