--------------Any Assumptions made about cards ------------------

@460 Should create two buttons, one to add another item and one to go to the cart
@460 When adding two of the same item to the cart, that item should only appear once in the cart but with a quantity of 2

@467 We assume that all items in the 'deal of the day' list should have a discounted price, and hence an original price. (not the case in the QA environment, as of 2014-10-28)
