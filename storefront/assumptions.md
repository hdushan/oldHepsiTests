--------------Any Assumptions made about cards ------------------

@460 Should create two buttons, one to add another item and one to go to the cart
@460 When adding two of the same item to the cart, that item should only appear once in the cart but with a quantity of 2

@467 We assume that all items in the 'deal of the day' list should have a discounted price, and hence an original price. (not the case in the QA environment, as of 2014-10-28)

@116 This story was intended to include the preservation of the shopping cart when returning to the site after leaving as AC
@116 Scenario 2, showing the visual indication on cart has been moved to #244

@276 Nothing to test for this as it appears to be a placeholder

@141 refers to the 'Only' filter rather than 'Shipping style' which does not appear to be present on the page
